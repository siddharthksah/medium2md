## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/siddharthksah/medium2md.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

4. Install the package and its dependencies using `setup.py`:

## Usage

Run `medium2md` with:

When the process is complete, the script will ask if you wish to open the downloaded markdown file in your default editor.

## Output
The converted articles are stored in the output directory, which is created in the project's root directory.
